EV charging station finder
description - 
   The Smart EV Charging Station Availability and Navigation System is a web-based application designed to help electric vehicle users easily locate nearby charging stations and check their availability in a simple and efficient manner.
With the rapid growth of electric vehicles, one of the major challenges faced by users is finding an available charging station during travel. Often, users reach a station only to find it occupied, which leads to inconvenience and delays. This system aims to reduce that uncertainty by providing a structured and user-friendly platform.
The application allows users to:
Select a city and area using dependent dropdown menus
View available EV charging stations in that location
Check charging type (Fast/Normal)
See availability status
Refresh availability dynamically
Navigate directly to the location using Google Maps integration
The system is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing dynamic filtering logic and simulated real-time updates to enhance user interaction.
This project supports smart city development and promotes sustainable transportation by improving accessibility and convenience for EV users.
